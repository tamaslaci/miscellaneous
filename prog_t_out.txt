
Basic programming theorems

SUM
Summing numbers from 1 to 9 = 45

COUNT
Counting summer months = 3

MAXIMUM SELECT
Selecting maximum from an unordered sequence = 9, on position = 4
The unordered sequence was: < 4 6 8 9 1 2 5 3 7 >

FIND / SEARCH
First greater value than five = 6, on position = 6
In the ordered number sequence of < 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 >

DECIDE
Given number sequence: < 4 6 8 9 1 2 5 3 7 >
The number sequence has only positive numbers!

SELECT
Given string sequence:
< apple peach grapes strawberry raspberry grapefruit pineapple >
The string sequence contains: grapefruit on position: 6

COPY
Square numbers from 1 to 9:
< 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 >
Square even numbers from 1 to 9 (odd numbers unchanged):
< 1 4 3 16 5 36 7 64 9 >

ASSORT
Assort the even numbers from an undordered sequence (< 4 6 8 9 1 2 5 3 7 >):
Numbers: < 4 6 8 2 > number of items: 4
Assort the even numbers from an ordered sequence (< 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 >) to a dynamic array:
Numbers: < 2 4 6 8 >

ASSORT APART / DISTRIBUTE
Assort the numbers from an undordered sequence (< 4 6 8 9 1 2 5 3 7 >), as evens and odds:
Evens: < 4 6 8 2 >
Odds: < 9 1 5 3 7 >

Assort the numbers from an ordered sequence (< 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 >), as evens and odds to dynamic arrays:
Evens: < 2 4 6 8 >
Odds: < 1 3 5 7 9 >
